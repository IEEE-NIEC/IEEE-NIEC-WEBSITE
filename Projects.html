time news feed and presentations or everything that we want to watch. The project has been completed and the first prototype is ready, which is already installed in makers space. This
smart screen is capable of google search through voice recognition. Both electronics and
computer science engineering students are working in this project just like in industry. That’s
how professional attitude is developing in members, by working together.
Smart Dustbin
Smart Dustbin is the perfect example of smartness in non living things in our vicinity. As soon as
it detects a hand or throwing garbage is approaching, the mechanical system let its flab open

				<p>The robots operate semi or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well-being of humans and equipment. With the aim of keeping our robot as simple as possible, while able to perform the initial goals, i.e. a vacuum cleaner robot that is capable to clean with the minimum human assistance.
The specifications correspond to some of the expected behaviours that will be programmed into the robot.
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a vacuum robot prototype by using AVR Microcontroller to achieve the goal of this project. This Vacuum Robot has several characterstics that are user-friendly, Enhanced Vaccum Suction, Longer battery life, Battery monitor  alarm and most importantly its very less cost as compared to similar products in market.
Another objective of this robot is to provide a substantial solution to the problem of manufacturing robotic cleaner utilizing local resources while keeping it's cost low as much as possible.
This robotic vacuum cleaner, often called a robovac, is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner that is intelligently programmed and designed such that it uses spinning brushes to reach tight corners, Carpet boost mechanism, edge cleaning of room and Mopping system. Also it provides a number of cleaning options simultaneous to vacuuming, thus rendering the machine into more than just a robot "vacuum cleaner".
This robot can be operated in both Fully Autonomous Mode and Manual mode.
Each cleaning and operating mechanism  has its own advantages and disadvantages.
For example, if operating in fully autonomous mode using floor mapping mechanism is relatively faster, less time consuming and energy efficient but slightly less efficient in cleaning while operating it in manual mode by operating it via Android App takes a much extra time, consumes more power but is much more efficient in cleaning.

				<p>3D LED Displays come in all manner of shapes and sizes. The one thing they all share in common is the ability to display changing light patterns in three dimensional space.

A Typical 3D LED Display is a collection of LEDs, anywhere from 8 to thousands, somehow connected and arranged in a 3D pattern and controlled so that the LEDs can be made to turn on and off or vary in brightness in a controlled manner, thus creating interesting and pleasant patterns of light.

Probably the most common type of 3D LED display is the LED cube, though there have been several notable exceptions. The typical 3D LED display has LEDs that are either single color, multi color or full color RGB. The 3D matrix is constructed either by soldering the legs of the LEDs directly together or by constructing a matrix of wires which form a frame that the LEDs are connected to. There are a few exceptions to the rigid frame method including hanging from string or wires. There are also many different ways to control a 3D LED display which vary in complexity, the simplest is probably a single micro-controller, with more complicated methods using special LED Driver ICs or even direct PC control.

				<p>A major change that has occurred in the Western family is an increased incidence in divorce. Whereas in the past, divorce was a relatively rare occurrence, in recent times it has become quite commonplace. This change is borne out clearly in census figures. For example thirty years ago in Australia, only one marriage in ten ended in divorce; nowadays the figure is more than one in three (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996: p.45). A consequence of this change has been a substantial increase in the number of single parent families and the attendant problems that this brings (Kilmartin, 1997).

An important issue for sociologists, and indeed for all of society, is why these changes in marital patterns have occurred. In this essay I will seek to critically examine a number of sociological explanations for the 'divorce phenomenon' and also consider the social policy implications that each explanation carries with it. It will be argued that the best explanations are to be found within a broad socio-economic framework.

al problems' (p.301). Bilton et al. therefore believe that changes in divorce rates can be best explained in terms of changes in the legal system. The problem with this type of explanation however, is that it does not consider why these laws have changed in the first place. It could be argued that reforms to family law, as well as the increased rate of divorce that has accompanied them, are the product of more fundamental changes in society.
other type of explanation is one that focuses precisely on these broad societal changes. For example, Nicky Hart (cited in Haralambos, 1995) argues that increases in divorce and marital breakdown are the result of economic changes that have affected the family. One example of these changes is the raised material aspirations of families, which Hart suggests has put pressure on both spouses to become wage earners. Women as a result have been forced to become both homemakers and economic providers. According to Hart, the contradiction of these two roles has lead to conflict and this is the main cause of marital breakdown. It would appear that Hart's explanation cannot account for all cases of divorce - for example, marital breakdown is liable to occur in families where only the husband is working. Nevertheless, her approach, which is to relate changes in family relations to broader social forces, would seem to be more probing than one that looks only at legislative change.

To provide access to big amount of students keeping security in mind is an important task for
maker space. To resolve this, student members have developed smart gate lock accessed by
RFID tags placed at the IEEE membership cards of student members. Every time a member
enters and scans to lock, his information details along with time will be uploaded to the drive
automatically as the lock is connected to internet whole time. This opens another opportunity

				<p>A major change that has occurred in the Western family is an increased incidence in divorce. Whereas in the past, divorce was a relatively rare occurrence, in recent times it has become quite commonplace. This change is borne out clearly in census figures. For example thirty years ago in Australia, only one marriage in ten ended in divorce; nowadays the figure is more than one in three (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996: p.45). A consequence of this change has been a substantial increase in the number of single parent families and the attendant problems that this brings (Kilmartin, 1997).

An important issue for sociologists, and indeed for all of society, is why these changes in marital patterns have occurred. In this essay I will seek to critically examine a number of sociological explanations for the 'divorce phenomenon' and also consider the social policy implications that each explanation carries with it. It will be argued that the best explanations are to be found within a broad socio-economic framework.

al problems' (p.301). Bilton et al. therefore believe that changes in divorce rates can be best explained in terms of changes in the legal system. The problem with this type of explanation however, is that it does not consider why these laws have changed in the first place. It could be argued that reforms to family law, as well as the increased rate of divorce that has accompanied them, are the product of more fundamental changes in society.
other type of explanation is one that focuses precisely on these broad societal changes. For example, Nicky Hart (cited in Haralambos, 1995) argues that increases in divorce and marital breakdown are the result of economic changes that have affected the family. One example of these changes is the raised material aspirations of families, which Hart suggests has put pressure on both spouses to become wage earners. Women as a result have been forced to become both homemakers and economic providers. According to Hart, the contradiction of these two roles has lead to conflict and this is the main cause of marital breakdown. It would appear that Hart's explanation cannot account for all cases of divorce - for example, marital breakdown is liable to occur in families where only the husband is working. Nevertheless, her approach, which is to relate changes in family relations to broader social forces, would seem to be more probing than one that looks only at legislative change.
